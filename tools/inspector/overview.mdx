## Three Ways to Use

There are three ways to access the MCP Inspector:

### 1. Online Version (Recommended for Testing)

Visit [inspector.mcp-use.com](https://inspector.mcp-use.com/inspector) - no installation required!

Perfect for quick testing and exploring MCP servers without any setup.

### 2. Run Locally with NPX

```bash
npx @mcp-use/inspector
```

Opens the inspector in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`. Great for development when you need local access.

<Accordion title="CLI Options">
  ```bash
  # Auto-connect to a server
  npx @mcp-use/inspector --url http://localhost:3000/mcp

  # Use custom port
  npx @mcp-use/inspector --port 9000

  # Combine both
  npx @mcp-use/inspector --url http://localhost:3000/mcp --port 9000
  ```
</Accordion>

### 3. Auto-mounted with mcp-use Servers

When you create an MCP server with `mcp-use`, the inspector is automatically available at `/inspector`:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from "mcp-use/server";

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: "my-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

server.listen(3000);
// Inspector automatically available at http://localhost:3000/inspector
```

This is the most convenient option for development as it's always available alongside your server.

## Privacy & Security

<Info>
  All authentication tokens, credentials, and API keys are stored **locally in your browser's localStorage**.
  Nothing is sent to external servers - everything stays on your device.
</Info>

The inspector is designed with privacy in mind:

- **Local Storage**: All connection data stored in browser
- **No Cloud Sync**: Your data never leaves your machine
- **Client-Side Only**: All requests go directly from your browser to MCP servers
- **Self-Hosting**: Deploy your own instance for full control
