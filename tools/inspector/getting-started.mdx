# Getting Started with Inspector

This guide will walk you through connecting to an MCP server and testing your first tool.

## Accessing the Inspector

Choose the method that works best for your workflow:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Online">
    Visit [inspector.mcp-use.com](https://inspector.mcp-use.com/inspector)

    **Best for:**
    - Quick testing without installation
    - Exploring public MCP servers
    - Sharing with team members
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="NPX">
    ```bash
    npx @mcp-use/inspector
    ```

    Opens at `http://localhost:8080`

    **Best for:**
    - Local development
    - Testing private servers
    - Offline work
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Auto-Mounted">
    ```typescript
    import { MCPServer } from "mcp-use/server";

    const server = new MCPServer({
      name: "my-server",
      version: "1.0.0",
    });

    server.listen(3000);
    ```

    Available at `http://localhost:3000/inspector`

    **Best for:**
    - Integrated development workflow
    - Always-on debugging access
    - Production testing
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Dashboard

When you open the inspector, you'll see the main dashboard with two panels:

- **Connected Servers** (left): Shows all your active MCP server connections
- **Connect Panel** (right): Add new server connections

</Frame>

## Connecting to a Server

Follow these steps to connect to an MCP server:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Connect Panel">
    Click the **Connect** panel on the right side of the dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Transport Type">
    Choose your connection transport:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Streamable HTTP">
        For SSE (Server-Sent Events) connections. Most common for HTTP-based MCP servers.

        ```
        http://localhost:3000/mcp
        ```
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="WebSocket">
        For WebSocket connections. Better for real-time bidirectional communication.

        ```
        ws://localhost:3000/mcp
        ```
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="stdin/stdio">
        For local process connections (advanced use case).
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Server URL">
    Input your MCP server endpoint:

    **Public servers:**
    ```
    https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
    ```

    **Local development:**
    ```
    http://localhost:3000/mcp
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Authentication (Optional)">
    If your server requires authentication:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="OAuth">
        1. Enter OAuth credentials
        2. Click **Connect**
        3. Approve access in popup window
        4. Inspector handles redirect automatically
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="API Headers">
        Add custom headers for API key authentication:

        ```json
        {
          "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
          "X-API-Key": "your-key-here"
        }
        ```
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Connect">
    The inspector will establish the connection and show the server in your **Connected Servers** list with a green status indicator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your First Tool Test

Once connected, let's test a tool:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Server">
    In the **Connected Servers** panel, click **"Inspect"** on your connected server.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Tools Tab">
    You'll see the server detail view with multiple tabs. The **Tools** tab is selected by default.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse Tools">
    Scroll through the list of available tools. Each tool shows:
    - Tool name
    - Description
    - Number of parameters
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a Tool">
    Click on a tool to view its detailed schema and input parameters.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Parameters">
    Fill in the JSON input panel with the required parameters:

    ```json
    {
      "city": "San Francisco"
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
      The inspector validates your input against the tool's schema in real-time.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute">
    Click the **"Execute"** button to run the tool.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Results">
    Results appear in the output panel with:
    - Syntax-highlighted JSON
    - Execution time
    - Success/error status
    - Widget rendering (if applicable)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Testing the Linear MCP Server

Let's walk through a complete example using the Linear MCP server:

<CodeGroup>

```text Connect
URL: https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
Transport: Streamable HTTP
```

```json Authenticate
1. Click Connect
2. Approve Linear OAuth in popup
3. Wait for green status indicator
```

```json Test create_issue Tool
{
  "title": "Test issue from Inspector",
  "description": "Testing the Linear MCP integration",
  "teamId": "your-team-id"
}
```

```json View Response
{
  "success": true,
  "issueId": "ISS-123",
  "url": "https://linear.app/team/issue/ISS-123"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up your workflow with keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + K` | Open quick search and navigation |
| `Esc` | Close modals and overlays |

### Quick Search Features

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to:
- Quickly connect to a new server
- Jump to recently used servers
- Search and execute tools directly
- Navigate to different tabs
- Access documentation

## Session Persistence

The inspector automatically saves your work:

<Check>
  **Persisted across reloads:**
  - Server connections
  - Authentication credentials
  - Session preferences
  - Recent tool calls
</Check>

Clear all sessions anytime with the **"Clear All"** button in the top bar.

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Failed" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Server URL is incorrect
    - Server is not running
    - CORS issues (for remote servers)
    - Network/firewall blocking connection

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify server URL and port
    - Check server logs for errors
    - Ensure server allows CORS from inspector origin
    - Test with `curl` to confirm server is responding
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OAuth Not Working" icon="lock">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Popup blocked by browser
    - Invalid OAuth credentials
    - Redirect URL not configured

    **Solutions:**
    - Allow popups for the inspector domain
    - Verify OAuth client ID and secret
    - Check OAuth redirect URLs in provider settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools Not Appearing" icon="wrench">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Server hasn't registered tools yet
    - Connection established before server ready
    - Server error during tool registration

    **Solutions:**
    - Disconnect and reconnect
    - Check server logs for registration errors
    - Verify tools are properly exported in server code
