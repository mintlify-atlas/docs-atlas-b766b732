## Installing LangChain Providers

mcp-use works with various LLM providers through LangChain. You'll need to install the appropriate LangChain provider package for your chosen LLM:

<CodeGroup>

```bash OpenAI
pip install langchain-openai
```

pip install langchain-anthropic
```

```bash Google
pip install langchain-google-genai
```

```bash Groq
pip install langchain-groq
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Only models with **tool calling capabilities** can be used with mcp-use. Make sure your chosen model supports function calling or tool use.
</Note>

For other providers, check the [LangChain chat models documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/).

## Optional Dependencies

### Sandbox Execution (E2B)

To use sandboxed execution for running MCP servers in isolated environments:

```bash
pip install "mcp-use[e2b]"
```

You'll also need an E2B API key. Sign up at [e2b.dev](https://e2b.dev) to get your API key.

### Search Functionality

For enhanced search capabilities:

```bash
pip install "mcp-use[search]"
```

### All Optional Dependencies

To install everything:

```bash
pip install "mcp-use[dev,anthropic,openai,e2b,search]"
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash .env
# LLM Provider Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key

# Optional: E2B for sandboxed execution
E2B_API_KEY=your_e2b_api_key
```
