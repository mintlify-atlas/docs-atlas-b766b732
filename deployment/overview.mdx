## Choosing a Deployment Strategy

### Manufact Cloud (Recommended)

**Best for:**
- Quick production deployments
- Teams wanting managed infrastructure
- Projects requiring observability and metrics
- GitHub-based workflows

**Key Features:**
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Branch-based deployments
- Built-in observability and logging
- Custom domains
- Zero infrastructure management

### Self-Hosted

**Best for:**
- Organizations with strict data requirements
- Custom infrastructure needs
- Air-gapped environments
- Complete control over resources

**Key Features:**
- Full control over infrastructure
- Custom networking configurations
- On-premises deployment options
- Integration with existing DevOps pipelines

### Docker

**Best for:**
- Consistent environments across dev/staging/prod
- Kubernetes deployments
- Multi-cloud strategies
- CI/CD pipelines

**Key Features:**
- Containerized deployments
- Easy scaling and orchestration
- Environment isolation
- Portable across cloud providers

## Architecture Considerations

### Network Requirements

MCP servers communicate over HTTP/HTTPS using the Model Context Protocol. Ensure your deployment environment allows:

- **Inbound HTTP/HTTPS** traffic on your configured port (default: 3000)
- **Outbound HTTPS** for external API calls (if your tools require them)
- **WebSocket support** for SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming

### Resource Requirements

<Note>
  Minimum requirements vary based on your server's complexity and expected load.
</Note>

**Typical MCP Server:**
- **CPU**: 0.5-1 vCPU
- **Memory**: 512MB-1GB RAM
- **Storage**: 1-5GB (depends on widgets and assets)

**High-Traffic MCP Server:**
- **CPU**: 2+ vCPUs
- **Memory**: 2GB+ RAM
- **Storage**: 5-10GB

### Environment Variables

Most MCP deployments require configuration via environment variables:

```bash
# Common environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
MCP_SERVER_URL=https://your-server.run.mcp-use.com/mcp

# API keys and secrets (tool-specific)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...
WORKOS_API_KEY=sk-...
```

<Warning>
  Never commit API keys or secrets to version control. Use environment variables or secret management systems.
</Warning>

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication

1. **OAuth Integration**: Use OAuth providers (WorkOS, Auth0, Supabase) for user authentication
2. **API Keys**: Secure your MCP endpoints with API key authentication
3. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production

### Secret Management

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manufact Cloud">
    ```bash
    # Set environment variables during deployment
    mcp-use deploy --env OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    
    # Or use .env file
    mcp-use deploy --env-file .env.production
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
    ```bash
    # Use systemd environment files
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mcp-server.service
    EnvironmentFile=/etc/mcp-server/env
    
    # Or Docker secrets
    docker secret create openai_key ./openai_key.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Docker">
    ```bash
    # Use Docker secrets
    docker run -d \
      --env-file .env.production \
      --secret openai_key \
      your-mcp-server
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Network Security

- **Firewall Rules**: Restrict access to trusted IP ranges
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS headers appropriately

## Monitoring and Observability

### Built-in Tools

MCP-use includes built-in observability features:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from "mcp-use/server";
import { Langfuse } from "langfuse";

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: "my-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  observability: {
    langfuse: new Langfuse({
      secretKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY,
      publicKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,
      baseUrl: process.env.LANGFUSE_HOST,
    }),
  },
});
```

### Metrics to Monitor

- **Request Rate**: Number of tool calls per minute
- **Latency**: Response time for tool execution
- **Error Rate**: Failed tool calls and error types
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and network utilization

## Health Checks

All MCP servers expose a health check endpoint:

```bash
# Health check endpoint
curl https://your-server.run.mcp-use.com/healthz

# Response
{"status": "ok", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T10:30:00Z"}
```

Use this endpoint for:
- Load balancer health checks
- Container orchestration readiness probes
- Uptime monitoring
